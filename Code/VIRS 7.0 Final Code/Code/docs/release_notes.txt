VIRS v6.3.1
Date 07/19/2020
The Enhanced Text page now has an infinite scroll feature, so the app does not become unresponsive
when large files are processed.

OutOfMemoryError bug was fixed that would occur when processing large files. The solution was
to break down the query that retrieves distinct words from the database that match the
words extracted from a file into smaller queries.

Bug was fixed of not being able to upload a new file without refreshing the page after
a file processing failure when the message "Oh snap! The file is not readable." appears.
Before the fix, when a user would choose a new file to upload, it would not get uploaded,
because the previous file would stay in memory and would fail again. From the perspective
of a user, it seemed as if processing of any file would always fail after a single failure,
because there was no way for a user to see what was happening in memory. After fixing the
bug, when processing of a file fails, a user can upload a new file which now correctly
replaces the old file in memory.

The image processor was changed to account for images with text arranged in columns. Before, 
the app took the processed text returned from textract and output it in a way that was effectively
just reading left to right, from the top of the page to the bottom. Now the location of each line is
analysed to determine if the image has columns of text, then it is all output in the correct order.

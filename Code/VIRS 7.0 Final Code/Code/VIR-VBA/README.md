## Description
I am only describing the most important files and folders here. If there is something that's not clear use your best friend in the hole wolrd 'Google' 

Folder/File | Description
--- | --- 
code                | The original code after been exported from the update.xlsm file. You might not need too use it directly. The purpose of this is to keep the code in version constrol, since 'update.xlsm' is a binary.
data                | The data provided.
sql                 | The final processed data to update the database.
README.md           | This readme file (talking about recursion...)
update.xlsm         | An excel file that contains a macro to create the sql.

Make sure to change the name of the files that are on this folder to another version name, as every time you make a prod-build or prod it will save the file
with the name bundle-VIR-Backend-6.3.0.zip

One thing to work on could be checking where the name is defaulting and changing it so that it constatly updates on production.
